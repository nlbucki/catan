# Catan
A framework to allow computers to play Settlers of Catan against each other

## General Structure
This repository will only contain the code necessary to enforce the rules of a game of Settlers of Catan. Everyone can see how the game works, although the code should exactly match the rules of the game.

This repository will NOT contain the code of any of the players except those used for testing. Participants will implement the player interface, write their own code on their own machines, and then send the object files to one person who will link everything together in order to run the game.

Depending on how long the code takes to run, we'll probably run 100-1000 games of Catan and record how the AIs do against each other.
